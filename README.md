# E-Commerce-User-Dataset-Analysis-using-MySQL-Workbench

**Ecommerce Data Analysis using MySQL**

**Introduction**

This project focuses on analyzing ecommerce user data using MySQL. The dataset consists of user information from an ecommerce platform, allowing us to gain insights into user behavior and business performance. By leveraging SQL queries, we can extract valuable information from the dataset to understand user demographics, preferences, and activity on the platform.


**Dataset**

•	File: users_data.csv

•	Rows: 98913

•	Columns: 24



**Tasks**

1.	Create a new schema named ecommerce.
   
2.	Import the users_data.csv file into MySQL using the Table Data import Wizard.
   
3.	View the structure of the imported table.
   
4.	Select the first 100 rows of the database.
   
5.	Determine the number of distinct values for the country and language fields.
   
6.	Identify whether male users or female users have the maximum followers.
    
7.	Calculate the total number of users who use profile pictures, ecommerce applications, Android app, and iOS app.
    
8.	Calculate the total number of buyers for each country and sort the result in descending order.
    
9.	Calculate the total number of sellers for each country and sort the result in ascending order.
    
10.	Display the top 10 countries with the maximum product pass rate.
    
11.	Calculate the number of users on the ecommerce platform for different language choices.
    
12.	Analyze the choice of female users regarding wishlist or social likes.
    
13.	Analyze the choice of male users regarding being a seller or buyer.
    
14.	Determine the country with the maximum number of buyers.
    
15.	List the top 10 countries with zero sellers.
    
16.	Display the records of the top 110 users who have recently used the ecommerce platform.
    
17.	Calculate the number of female users who have not logged in for the last 100 days.
    
18.	Display the number of female users for each country on the ecommerce platform.
    
19.	Display the number of male users for each country on the ecommerce platform.
    
20.	Calculate the average number of products sold and bought by male users for each country.
    
# How to Run the Project on MySQL Workbench

1.	Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL database server.
   
2.	Create a new schema named ecommerce using the following SQL command:
   
CREATE SCHEMA ecommerce; 

3.	Import the users_data.csv file into the ecommerce schema using the Table Data import Wizard.
   
4.	Once imported, you can execute the SQL queries provided for each task in the project description to perform the analysis.
   
5.	To execute a SQL query, simply copy and paste it into the SQL editor in MySQL Workbench and click on the "Execute" button.
    
**Conclusion**

This project demonstrates the power of SQL in analyzing ecommerce user data to extract valuable insights for business decision-making. By performing various queries on the dataset, we can uncover patterns, trends, and performance metrics that can inform strategic initiatives and optimize the ecommerce platform's operations.
